üîç Curious about the queries? Check out the [project_sql folder](/project_sql/)!

# Background
This project was designed to explore the data scientist job market more effectively by identifying top-paying and in-demand skills.

The dataset is derived from my [SQL Course](https://www.lukebarousse.com/sql) and contains valuable insights into job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data scientist jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data scientists?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
To conduct an in-depth analysis of the data scientist job market, I utilized a range of essential tools:

- **SQL:** The foundation of my analysis, enabling me to retrieve data and uncover vital insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The selected database management system, helping me to manage the job posting datasets.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My preferred tool for managing databases and running SQL queries efficiently.
- **Git & GitHub:** Crucial for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analyses, facilitating collaboration and tracking progress.
